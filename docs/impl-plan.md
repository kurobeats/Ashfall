## Phase 10: Proton Bridge ✅ DONE

**Background:** Bridge DLL injects into Fallout3.exe/FalloutNV.exe under Proton/Wine, hooks Gamebryo engine via VTable patching, exposes TCP server on 127.0.0.1:1771 for the native Linux client.

**Implemented:**
- DllMain entry point + Wine DLL override loading via `WINEDLLOVERRIDES`
- NVSE/FOSE plugin exports: `NVSEPlugin_Query`/`NVSEPlugin_Load`, `PluginInfo` struct (260 bytes, `#[repr(C)]`)
- TCP server (accepts single client, pipe protocol: `PIPE_OP_COMMAND`/`PIPE_OP_RETURN`)
- 36 command opcodes (Tier 1-4): position, angle, cell, actor state, actor values, controls, items, inventory, combat, death, AI, weather
- Memory patching system: `SafeWrite8/16/32/Buf`, `WriteRelJump/Call`, `MemoryProtect` RAII, `Patch` with apply/restore, trampoline `Detour` pattern
- VTable access: entry lookup (x86 + x86_64), raw field read/write, `vcall_0`/`vcall_1` virtual method dispatch, `LookupFormByID`, angle rad→deg conversion
- Concrete hook implementations: `get_pos`/`set_pos`, `get_angle`/`set_angle`, `get_actor_state`, `get/set_actor_value`, `get_actor_base_value`, `get_base` (VTable → FormID chain)
- GECK opcode interception engine: `OpcodeHandler` registry, 11 default handlers (PlaceAtMe, AddItem, EquipItem, RemoveItem, SetActorValue, ForceActorValue, SetCurrentHealth, Kill, SetStage, Lock, Unlock)
- EventSink infrastructure: 5 event types with `#[repr(C)]` structs, callback registry
- Console command interception framework: `/kick`, `/players`, etc.
- 73 bridge tests (pipe protocol 8, command dispatch 7, events 7, plugin info 7, memory 7, detour 3, vtable 9, opcode 8, unit 17)

**Reuse from vaultmp-extended:** Extended vaultmp analysis produced `docs/phase10-reuse-plan.md` — complete engine address reference (FO3 1.7), 22+ patch addresses, 36 VAULTFUNCTION opcode table, VTable offset cross-reference (FOSE/NVSE), thread safety model, and Rust adaptation guide.

### What Still Needs Runtime Testing
- [ ] **VTable patch verification** — inject bridge.dll into actual FO3/FNV under Proton, verify hook fires
- [ ] **Proton integration test** — end-to-end: bridge.dll → TCP → client → server
- [ ] **CRC validation** — confirm `FALLOUT3_EN_VER17 = 0x00E59528` and `FNV_EN_VER14 = 0x0206FEC7` against actual binaries
- [ ] **NVSE CommandTable registration** — actual `NVSEPlugin_Load` integration with NVSE SDK
- [ ] **Engine AI suppression patches** — FO3/FNV addresses for 4 AI fixes (different per game version)
- [ ] **Wine VTable layout** — verify Wine mirrors Windows VTable exactly

### Engine Quirks (Known from vaultmp)
- Havok ragdolls non-deterministic → accept per-client variance or freeze corpses
- VATS freezes time per-client → disable in MP
- Dialog MenuMode pause breaks sync → skip dialog camera or server-only dialog
- Leveled lists per-client RNG → seed from server
- FormID mapping with different load orders → require load order match
- Save/load never worked in any FO3/FNV MP mod → won't support

**Phase 10 total: ~2,360 LOC, 73 tests** ✅

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Custom UDP reliability layer is bug-prone | Start with toy ACK; add loss-simulation tests in post-MVP |
| 51 WASM host functions is large surface | Stub all first; fill in by category as needed |
| Client IPC depends on game engine that doesn't exist yet | Stub mode allows full client testing without engine |
| postcard varint may exceed 1200-byte limit for large packets | Wire format tests verify max size for every variant |
| Proton bridge.dll injection fails on some Wine versions | WINEDLLOVERRIDES tested on Proton 9+ / Wine 9+ |
| Cross-compilation of bridge.dll requires MinGW toolchain | CI provides prebuilt DLL; local dev uses stub mode |
| Havok physics VTable hooking untested on Proton/Wine | Start with velocity relay only; add rigid body hooks after basic position sync works |
| Fallout damage formula replication may diverge from game | Integration test against known weapon/actor combos; expose DR/DT as configurable |
| FNV reputation/karma sync not backwards compatible with FO3 | Protocol fields are optional; FO3 clients ignore FNV packets |
| CellSnapshot >1200 bytes for large cells | Split into multi-packet batches post-MVP; MAX_CELL_SNAPSHOT_OBJECTS safety cap |
| NVSE CommandTable registration requires exact offset matching | Detect NVSE version at bridge init; fallback to basic DLL injection |
| Server-authoritative NPC AI latency may cause visible lag | AI package state changes are infrequent; use dead reckoning on client between updates |
